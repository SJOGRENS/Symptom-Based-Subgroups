# Symptom-Based-Subgroups
The NSST Excel macro allows users to stratify patients into four symptom-based subgroups (the Low Symptom Burden (LSB), High Symptom Burden (HSB), Dryness Dominant with Fatigue (DDF) and Pain Dominant with Fatigue (PDF)) according to their symptom scores on the EULAR Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) 0-10 numerical scale for Pain, Fatigue and Dryness together with the Anxiety and Depression sub-scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on a 0-21 scale.

The macro is available for academic use.  It may be used freely for research purposes by all researchers citing the original reference.
